Add the line import time at the top of both files, as the first line in the file get the start time with `start_time = time.time()`. End the program by getting the time again and subtracting the start time from it to get the total run time. Add `end_time = time.time()` and `print(\"Elapsed time:\",end_time-start_time,\"seconds\")` to the end of both files. Compare how long both programs take to run generating 4,000 samples and testing them for between 2 and 10 clusters. How much did your run times differ? How much do they differ if you increase the number of samples to 8,000? How long do you think it would take to compute 800,000 samples (estimate this, it might take a while to run for real)?"
